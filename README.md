# open-vsx.org

This repository contains the source of [open-vsx.org](https://open-vsx.org), the public instance of [Eclipse Open VSX](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx). Most of the code is maintained in [eclipse/openvsx](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx), while here you'll find only adaptations specific to the public instance.

The main artifact is the Docker image available at [ghcr.io/eclipsefdn/openvsx-website](https://github.com/orgs/EclipseFdn/packages/container/package/openvsx-website). It contains the server application with customized frontend and base configuration.

## Claiming Namespace Ownership

If you want to refute a previously granted ownership, please comment on the corresponding issue.

## Getting started

Enable Yarn, install dependencies, build assets and start a dev server:

```bash
cd website
corepack enable
corepack prepare yarn@stable --activate
yarn --cwd website
yarn --cwd website compile
yarn --cwd website build
yarn --cwd website build:dev
yarn --cwd website start:dev
```

### Development
